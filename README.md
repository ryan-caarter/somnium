Bay Dreams App (proposed)

Concept Flutter app for the Bay Dreams festivals in New Zealand.

Allows a user to:
- Choose the festival they are attending
- Check out the full lineup
- Listen to each artists discography with Spotify or Youtube
- View the map of the festival
- Buy tickets
- Schedule acts the user wants to attend, notifying the user 15 minutes before the act starts (set to 5s after scheduling for testing)

The app works totally offline in the case that the festival has celluar network congestion, so scheduled act notifications aren't affected.
There are two versions of the app for both North and South Island festivals.
